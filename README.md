# WebCube

A template that enables you to create a 3D cube showcasing your website's pages on its sides.<br><br>

# Active Implementation

Active implementation features an `updateCubeScale()` function to update the cube scale and give the impression of the cube being closer or further away. This is actively handled via the mouse scroll wheel. It also features a basic animation making the cube spin 360 degrees on one axis. When the cube is clicked, the animation pauses in place and can be continued by clicking again. If the animation has completed, clicking the cube again will trigger the animation again.
